    <b>Why work with me?</b>

    <p>- I take full end-to-end ownership on my tasks & responsibilities, beyond expectations</p>

    <p>- I always start with why, both when assigned and assigning a task, all must be justified</p>
    <p>- I'm a quick & independent learner. I dive deep and reach quick results in unfamiliar topics</p>

    <b>What's my career timeline?</b>

    <b>Achievements</b>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>- I'm an ex. AWS SDE, built and deployed prod. SW at the heart of EC2 Networking, world-scale traffic</p>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>What have I learned?</b>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>- Agile & growth mindset are a must and always will be, and so are continuous learning and enthusiasm</p>
    <p>- Usually, the 'how' can be solved, the 'what' is a variation of something, but the 'why' is what's important, start with 'why'</p>
    <p>- SW, like many other things, is a means to a business or personal goal, the goal matters more</p>
    <p>- It's important? Prioritize. It's complex? Document. It's repeating? Automate. It's relevant for others? share. Can some AI do it? Let it.</p>
  </div>
