<details>
  <summary>
    <b>💡 What have I learned?</b>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <p>- Agile & growth mindset are a must and always will be, and so are continuous learning and enthusiasm, AI won't have these soon</p>
    <p>- Usually, the 'how' can be solved, the 'what' is just a variation of something known, but the 'why' is what's important, start with 'why'</p>
    <p>- SW, like many other things, is a means to a business or personal goal, the goal matters more than whatever SW you build for it</p>
    <p>- It's important? Prioritize. It's complex? Document. It's repeating? Automate. It's relevant for others? share. Can AI do it? Let it</p>
    <p>- AI can do your work if you teach it, but it's your work and so is the responsibility to lead, direct and validate the AI doing it</p>

    <b><span>Agentic RAG app for SW Incidents Responses - </span><a href=https://github.com/giladresisi/ir-copilot>Link</a><span> - RAGAS Faithfullness 0.950</span></b>
  </summary>
  <div>
    <span>Built and </span><a href=https://frontend-eosin-six-81.vercel.app/>deployed</a><span> an agentic RAG system using TypeScript and FastAPI for retrieving info from SW incidents reports and recent deployments with streamed responses. It utilizes both local models (LMStudio) and cloud-based (OpenAI, OpenRouter) that use multiple tools - including web-search (tavily), text-to-sql, subagent delegation and of-course chunks retrieval with hybrid search (pgvector + keyword), metadata filtering and reranking (local / cohere). The system includes out-of-the-box observability (LangSmith) and evaluations (classic RAGAS, tool selection, chat quality) and reached 0.950 faithfullness in RAGAS score</span>
